# CliboardSearch
This is a simple AutoHotkey file, that searches on Google for the currently selceted text with the shortcut "Ctrl + Shift + C".

For use with other common search engines swap "https://www.google.com/search?q=" for:

DuckDuckGo: "https://duckduckgo.com/?q="

Bing: "https://www.bing.com/search?q="

Yahoo!: "https://search.yahoo.com/search?p="

Ecosia: "https://www.ecosia.org/search?q="

If you want to do this with a search engine I didn't mention then search for any word for example "test", and then swap "https://www.google.com/search?q=" for whatever comes before it.

As an example on Google when I search for "test", I get "https://www.google.com/search?q=test", then I keep everything before "test" and get "https://www.google.com/search?q=".
